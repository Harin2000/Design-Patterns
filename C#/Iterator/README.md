The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

### The Single Responsibility Principle: A class should only have one reason to change.
- Every responsibility of a class is an area of potential change. More than one responsibility means more than one area of change.
- This principle guides us to keep each class to a single responsibility.
- Cohesion is a term youâ€™ll hear used as a measure of how closely a class or a module supports a single purpose or responsibility.
- We say that a module or class has high cohesion when it is designed around a set of related functions, and we say it has low cohesion when it is designed around a set of unrelated functions. Cohesion is a more general concept than the Single Responsibility Principle, but the two are closely related.
- Classes that adhere to the principle tend to have high cohesion and are more maintainable than classes that take on multiple responsibilities and have low cohesion.
